# Dataset

### Finding Datasets

There are many sources for datasets, but my favorite is [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets).

Today we will be exploring "Most Streamed Spotify Songs 2024" 
* the source on kaggle is [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/most-streamed-spotify-songs-2024).
* or you can find a copy in the repo
